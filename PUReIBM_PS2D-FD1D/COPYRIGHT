!    PUReIBM-PS2D-FD1D is a three-dimensional psudeo-spectral particle-resolved
!    direct numerical simulation solver for detailed analysis of homogeneous
!    fixed and freely evolving fluid-particle suspensions. PUReIBM-PS2D-FD1D
!    is a continuum Navier-Stokes and scalar solvers based on Cartesian grid that utilizes
!    Immeresed Boundary method to represent particle surfuces. The details about the solvers
!    can be found in the below papers in SUBRAMANIAM's group.
